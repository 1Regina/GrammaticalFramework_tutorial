|   3	|  Concrete lincat must include all the abstract cat 	                            |   Yes, Recommended otherwise it will default to the general										|
|   4	|  Concrete Lin is definitions of how each part/token work (auto or with others)    |   Yes. Defining how the arguments will be used.												|
|   5	|  Abstract startcat can only have 1 cat 	                                    |   Yes. Bcos all roads (fun leads to Rome and there is only 1 Rome)									|

|   9	|  All abstract fun must be described/defined in concrete lin                       |   Yes if gg to import concrete.gf ("child"). But if just import abstract.gf ("mother"), then we can generate without. NB: If only import  |
|   	| 							                            |   mother, we can still generate abstract fun without concrete lin. But once concrete.gf ("child") imported, linearization is limited to  	|
